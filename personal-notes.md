- SOUUUUUUUUNDDDD
- Have a diagram showing the win/loss condition instead of just text
- Feedback on whether a level is "reset"
- Still able to restart if paused in level
- A warning if a level is impossible to lose or win
- Have entities avoid other entities when pathfinding (boid like behavior)
- Have a visual of what kinds of enemies to slay / left alive. Perhaps the entities that need to be kept alive are in green and those that need killing are red.
- Nests won't suddenly change target if another quakka comes into contact
- Waterballs placed during pausing should work, and not just sit there. Is also not cleaned up properly.
- Can only go on to the next level after completing the current
- A next level btn after completing the current

# Potential changes to bevy
