# QOL
- Quakka immediately takes damage upon entering the range of a nest
- Have a diagram showing the win/loss condition instead of just text

## Usability issues for the editor:

# Necessary
- Attacker timer only ticks when enemy in range and resets when they exit
- Need to add proper pathfinding, having entities roughly follow the path and farmers run away from Quakka's instead of a preset path
- For Farmer Pathfinding, it could be running away from quakka but also following the path which would necessitate going on bridges
- Restrict placing on the water
- Have entities avoid other entities when pathfinding (boid like behavior)
- Have a visual of what kinds of enemies to slay / left alive. Perhaps the entities that need to be kept alive are in green and those that need killing are red.
- SOUUUUUUUUNDDDD
- Nests won't suddenly change target if another quakka comes into contact

# The last 90%
- Can only go on to the next level after completing the current
- A next level btn after completing the current

# Potential changes to bevy
- Implement the debug picker plugin to be able to be displayed in different spots
- Have the debug picker plugin appear over ui nodes

# Planning
## Going to implement farmers being able to escape
