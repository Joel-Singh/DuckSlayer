# QOL
- Quakka immediately takes damage upon entering the range of a nest

## Usability issues for the editor:
- Some Indication when the level is quicksaved or loaded

# Necessary
- Different win conditions for each level
- Attacker timer only ticks when enemy in range and resets when they exit

# The last 90%
- Can only go on to the next level after completing the current
- A next level btn after completing the current

# Potential changes to bevy
- Implement the debug picker plugin to be able to be displayed in different spots
- Have the debug picker plugin appear over ui nodes

# Planning
## Different Win/Loss Conditions
editor will have a menu for win and lose conditions

Some indication in editor when win and lose conditions are met
